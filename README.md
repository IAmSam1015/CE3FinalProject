Final Project for Professional Elective 3

### Steps on testing the app:

1. **Create Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give your virtual environment.

2. **Activate Virtual Environment:**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command installs all the dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` file into the virtual environment.

4. **Run the App:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Replace `main.py` with the name of your Python file containing the Dash application code.
